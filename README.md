prompts are given and then you are required to enter a password. the input is defined by a variable for Console.Readline and then used by an if statement, userinput == password value.

if the user input matches the seperately stored password variable it will output a correct prompt via Console.WriteLine.

else the userinput does not match the password variable then gives faliure prompt.
